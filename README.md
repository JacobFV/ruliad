# Ruliad

Ruliad is a comprehensive project that includes both a backend and frontend. The name 'Ruliad' is derived from the concept of a 'ruliad tree', a data structure used in computer science and linguistics to represent hierarchical relationships in a grammar.

This repository is designed to be user-friendly and easy to get started with, even for developers who are new to the project. Here are some step-by-step instructions to help you get started:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the backend directory and run `poetry install` to install the necessary Python dependencies.
3. To start the backend, use the command `poetry run python ruliad --help`.
4. Navigate to the frontend directory and run `npm install` to install the necessary JavaScript dependencies.
5. To start the frontend, use the command `npm start`.

If you prefer to run both the backend and frontend simultaneously, you can use Docker Compose. Simply navigate to the root directory of the project and run `docker-compose up`.
